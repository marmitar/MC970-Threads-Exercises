# Threads Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises focused on threads programming, split into multiple folders, each containing a specific exercise.

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise is located in a separate folder, and contains the necessary files and instructions to complete it. The instructions for each exercise are located in a README file in the respective exercise folder.

The exercises are designed to be completed in order, as each exercise builds upon the previous one. Therefore, it is recommended that you start with the first exercise and work your way through them in sequence.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mc970-1s23/threads-exercises-TiagodePAlves.git
```

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the first exercise folder and read the instructions in the README file. Follow the instructions to complete the exercise, and then move on to the next exercise in the sequence.

## Prerequisites

To complete these exercises, you will need a basic understanding of threads programming and the programming language used in the exercises (C or C++). You will also need a development environment for the language used in the exercises, as well as any necessary libraries or tools.

## Solutions and Answers

Solutions were made and tested in the hardware described in [MACHINE.md](MACHINE.md). The specific solutions can be found at:
